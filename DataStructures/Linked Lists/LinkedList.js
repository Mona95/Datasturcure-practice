/**
 * Linked lists store a sequentialÂ collection of elements but, unlike arrays,
 *  in linked lists the elements are not placed contiguously in memory.
 *  Each element consists of a node that stores the element itself and also a reference (also known as a pointer or link) that points to the next element.
 * One of the benefits of a linked list over a conventional array is that we do not need to shift elements over when adding or removing them. However,
 * we need to use pointers when working with a linked list and, because of this,
 *  we need to pay some extra attention when implementing a linked list. In the array, we can directly access any element at any position;
 *  in the linked list,
 *  if we want to access an element from the middle,
 *  we need to start from the beginning (head) and iterate the list until we find the desired element.

//linkedList contains a Node which has two parts (value,next poiner)
